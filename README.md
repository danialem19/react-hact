# React conversion of your site

This project mirrors your original layout and styling.

## Run
npm install
npm run dev

## Build
npm run build
npm run preview

### Notes
- Original styles are in `src/styles.css`.
- Original script (if present) is loaded from `public/legacy/script.js` to keep behavior.
- Images/assets were placed under `public/images` so existing paths like `images/...` still work.
